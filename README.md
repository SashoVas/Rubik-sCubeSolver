![rubiks cube project preview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4b9ec1e-f684-4547-bf3c-1956d3ecb37f)

This project is a **Rubik's Cube Solver** featuring a **custom-built 3D visualization**, multiple interaction methods, and an **AI-powered solving algorithm**.  

## ✨ Features  

🔹 **3D Visualization from Scratch** – The cube is rendered using a custom-built graphics engine with smooth animations and realistic interactions.  
🔹 **Interactive Controls** – Rotate the cube freely, perform moves manually, or scramble it with a single click.  
🔹 **AI Solver** – Automatically solves the cube using optimized algorithms, showing step-by-step animations.  

## 🎮 Ways to Interact  

✅ **Mouse & Keyboard Controls** – Rotate the cube and execute moves naturally.  
✅ **Touchscreen Support** – Swipe gestures to manipulate the cube.  
✅ **Algorithm Execution** – Enter sequences manually or let AI take over.  

## 🚀 How It Works  

1️⃣ **Scramble the Cube** – Generate a random state.  
2️⃣ **Solve Manually or with AI** – Try solving it yourself or let AI find the optimal solution.  
3️⃣ **Watch Step-by-Step Animations** – The AI solver demonstrates each move in real-time.  

Whether you're a beginner looking to explore or an expert speedsolver, this project provides an intuitive and powerful way to interact with and solve the Rubik’s Cube. 🧩🎯
